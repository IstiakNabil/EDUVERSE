Our platform is an innovative online marketplace designed to empower students by enabling them to both teach and learn from one another. The platform allows students to offer their expertise on specific topics—such as programming languages, mathematics, or other academic subjects—by creating personalized tutoring gigs. Other students who seek help or wish to learn new skills can easily browse these offerings and purchase one-on-one sessions or assistance for a set fee.

In addition to individual tutoring gigs, the platform also provides a space for users to create and sell comprehensive courses. This dual approach allows for both flexible, on-demand help and structured, in-depth learning experiences.

The platform operates on a commission-based model, earning revenue by charging a percentage fee from each transaction made through the site. This ensures a sustainable business model while keeping the service accessible and affordable for both tutors and learners.

Initially targeting the Bangladeshi market, the platform is designed with scalability in mind, with plans to expand internationally in the future. By fostering a peer-to-peer learning environment, the platform not only helps students earn income by sharing their knowledge but also makes quality education more accessible and affordable for all.
